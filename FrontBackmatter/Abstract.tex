\chapter*{Abstract}
An abstract is a brief of a research article, thesis, review,
conference proceeding or any in-depth analysis of a particular
subject or discipline, and is often used to help the reader
quickly ascertain the paper's purpose. When used, an abstract
always appears at the beginning of a manuscript or typescript,
acting as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper or
patent application. Abstracting and indexing services for various
academic disciplines are aimed at compiling a body of literature
for that particular subject.
